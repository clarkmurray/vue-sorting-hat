### Sorting Hat


## Stretch Goals


[ ] Add a random delay of 0 to 30 seconds to the sorting. During that wait, display a spinner so the user knows the Sorting Hat is thinking.

[ ] Ask a random number of questions, 0 to 5, before the Sorting Hat decides. There are sample questions in the provided data file. Choose the House most often selected in the answers to these questions.


[ ] Randomize the order of the answers to each question so that a user can't choose 'A' all the time to deliberately place themselves in Gryffindor.

[ ] Provide cryptic feedback from the Sorting Hat after every question, such as "That's interesting!" or "Really...!"


On initial page load, allow users to select their wizarding school. There are 11 to choose from, but we only have House information for a few so not every school choice wil lead a user to a Sorting Hat-like experience. See: https://www.pottermore.com/collection/wizarding-schools
